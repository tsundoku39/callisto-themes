# callisto-themes
Themes for the Callisto Desktop.

These themes began as a fork of the MATE TraditionalOk theme, which implements Clearlooks for GTK+ 3, modified to resemble the Clearlooks-Gray variant used in my early X11 desktop efforts. They have since evolved further, incorporating more texture than Clearlooks themes do, with influences from Apple Platinum, BeOS, QNX Neutrino, and elsewhere.

Major goals, in keeping with Callisto Desktop as a whole, are easily perceptible object state and visual comfort without sacrificing aesthetics.

Color variations match the GNOME-Colors-derived icon themes.
